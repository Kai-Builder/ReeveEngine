Sessiondata
Session Data Libraries Are Usually Stored In Vectors/Arrays And are used to store session variables for future reference inside of your scripts.
The Syntax Is:
svar <type> <name>{ <values> };
To use these you must include:
```

#include "redefinitions/datatypes/basics/types/sessions.h"

```
